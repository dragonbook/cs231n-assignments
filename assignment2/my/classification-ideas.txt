1. spatial transform net
2. unsuperised pre-training(like, use rotation or rigid transformation to
   generate samples and estimate transformation parameters. for example: Unsupervised Representation Learning by Predicting Image Rotations
3. automatic 2d/3d registration(unsuperised way, or no mannul superised way:))
